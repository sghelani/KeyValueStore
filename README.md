# KeyValueStore
Key-Value store implemented from scratch using the B+ Tree Data structure in Python

## Key Points:
* We can access and update key-value store using python dictionary like syntax.
* We can add new key-value pairs to it or update existing keys with new values in O(log n) time.
* We can iterate over all key-value pairs present in the data structure in O(N) time.
* We can perform range queries on the keys.
* We can fetch existing values for a key or check for the existence of a key in O(log n) time
